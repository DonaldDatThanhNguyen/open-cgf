#summary Using the test client

= Introduction =

This page tells you how to use the test client included in the package. The test client is...rather rudimentary at the moment. It only sends UDP packets and does not monitor the response.


= Details =

Run an erlang shell {{{ erl }}}

To perform a little torture test (duplicates, possible duplicates) use:
`test_udp_client:start_mockup( {{65,23,156,215}, 3386}).`

To replay an hardcoded packet from a GGSN
`test_udp_client:start_replay( {{65,23,156,215}, 3386},2).`

The open-cgf server IP address e.g. _{65,23,156,215}_ and port e.g. _3386_ will obviously need to be adjusted for your specific site.
