#summary Status of Project

= Introduction =

As at Feb 2008 this project is under active development. It requires testing with real live CDFs (SGSN/GGSNs) and I cannot do this.

If you'd like to use this in your (test) network, please do so, and send any questions or feedback to feedback@3gtelcotools.com or raise an issue here.

This server will eventually be production grade, but I wouldn't recommend it for that yet...

= TODO =

Things to do rough priority order

  * Make logging server log to disk
  * Make server reply to echo and node_alive requests
  * Make logging multi-process 
  * Make server respond to CDF (SGSN/GGSN) with data_record_transfer_response periodically, which should make it very efficient. Response should be tied to physical disk logging or file closing (TBD)
  * Make TCP server work, for GTPv0 clients who like TCP. Sad little things.
  * Enhance test program for TCP
  * Enhance test program to simulate failures/failovers
  * Exercise and debug failures/failovers
  * Use things learned from tim bray experiment to make writing faster
  * 

= DONE TO DATE =
 
  * Proper Erlang directory structure
  * Proper Erlang application, with a supervisor
  * Decoding of GTP' and all IEs from 0 up to version 2 (release 8 spec). 
  * UDP daemon listener
  * Logging server which is sequence number aware
  * Listener tied to decode, tied to logging server
