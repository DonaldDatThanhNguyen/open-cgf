== Cisco IP Transfer Point (ITP) ==
Cisco ITPs need to log CDRs when used in SMSC-bypass configuration that delivers directly to phones or to an third-paty using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPP SMPP]. They have a not-terribly-well-documented GTP' interface that appears to be completely differently to the Cisco GGSN GTP' interface. It is a lot less configurable.

open-cgf has had some initial successful testing with the Cisco ITP (thanks to Ilya!). It uses a the GTPv0 6 byte header version of GTP'.
